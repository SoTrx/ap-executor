# Configuration

This document describes how to configure the AP Executor service for different environments.

## Environment Variables

All variables have working defaults matching the underlying SDKs' own defaults, so nothing is strictly required to boot the service locally.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR` | `http://localhost:8500` | Consul agent address used for operator service discovery |
| `DAPR_RUNTIME_HOST` | `localhost` | Dapr sidecar host |
| `DAPR_GRPC_PORT` | `50001` | Dapr sidecar gRPC port |
| `DAPR_HTTP_PORT` | `3500` | Dapr sidecar HTTP port |
| `SYNC_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `60` | How long `POST /aps/execute` blocks before returning 504 and pointing the caller at the async endpoint instead |
| `ROOT_PATH` | `""` | API root path when behind a reverse proxy |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed for your environment (e.g. pointing `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR` at a real Consul cluster in production).

## Testing Configuration

Tests run entirely against mocks — an `httpx.MockTransport` for HTTP calls (Consul, manifests, operator invocations) and a fake Dapr workflow client for the API layer. No external services (Consul, Dapr sidecar, or otherwise) are needed to run the suite:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
